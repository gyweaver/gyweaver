- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gyweaver
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m new to web development and web design, so I'm trying to learn all the things.
- ðŸŒ± I started by learning the basics in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and now Iâ€™m learning web design on WordPress. 
- Feel free to reach out if you have any tips or insight for a web newbie!
